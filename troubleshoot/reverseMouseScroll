run
	xinput list | egrep "slave.*pointer" | grep -v XTEST
to get the input ID

get the input configuration from the device with id ID by running
	xinput get-button-map {ID}

use this output and reverse order of numbers 4 and 5 (becomes 5 4) to reverse mouse scrolling

run
	xinput set-button-map {ID} {REVERSED_OUTPUT}

Example:
	xinput set-button-map 12 1 2 3 5 4 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
reverses scroll of device with id 12, which originally has output 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
